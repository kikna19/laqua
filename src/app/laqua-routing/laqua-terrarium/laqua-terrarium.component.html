     The corn nake is named for the species' regular presence near grain stores, where it preys on mice and rats that
      eat harvested corn. The Oxford English Dictionary cites this usage as far back as 1675. Some sources maintain
      that the corn snake is so-named because the distinctive, nearly-checkered pattern of the snake's belly scales
      resembles the kernels of variegated corn.
